- Jul 2021 - Jan 2023 (Software Engineer)
- Feb 2023 - Dec 2023 (Software Engineering Team Lead)

I joined PT Advotics Teknologi Global, where I spent 2.5 years working on microservices-based architecture. For the first 2 years, I was a Backend Engineer in the Identity Team, responsible for developing and maintaining services related to user management, auth service, report builder, KPI calculations, and ETL applications.

At Advotics, we followed an Agile Scrum methodology with biweekly releases. I actively participated in daily standups, sprint planning, sprint retrospectives, and task breakdown sessions with the team lead developer.

In my last 6 months at Advotics, I was promoted to Team Leader of the Identity Team, where I took on greater leadership responsibilities. My role involved translating business logic into technical implementations, breaking down tasks for the team, reviewing pull requests, and leading task breakdown meetings to ensure smooth development and project delivery.
